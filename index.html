            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Dowling Briggs and I was born and raised in Birmingham, AL. I attended the University of Alabama graduating in 2017 with an MIS degree with a minor in Computing App & Technologies. I was hired by Accenture in Nashville straight out of college
                where I worked as an Application Development Associate Consultant working specifically in the RPA sector doing development work. RPA is Robotic Process Automation and was essentially building software robots for clients to help them improve
                the efficiency and accuracy of their business processes. I have since left the company and am trying to switch into a more traditional development role.

                In my free time I enjoy playing golf, going to concerts, and watching Alabama football. Both of my parents went to the Unviersity so we have strong ties to the University. I am currently getting my Google Advanced Data Analyticss certification in my spare
                time. I also spend some of my time at the Alabama Humane Society helping take care of the animals. I had a medical event occur in 2020 that has put me out of work but I am healed and ready to re-renter the workforce.
